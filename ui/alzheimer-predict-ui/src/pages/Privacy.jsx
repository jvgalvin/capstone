            <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
            <p>Effective Date: December 4, 2023</p>
            <br></br>
            <p>We are committed to safeguarding your privacy and providing transparency about our data practices. This Privacy Policy details how we collect, use, and protect your information. By using the app, you agree to the terms outlined in this policy.</p>
            <h3>1. Information We Collect</h3>
            <h4>1.1 Personal Information</h4>
            <p>We collect and store personal information provided by physicians and patients, including but not limited to:</p>
                <ul>- Patient demographics (date of birth, gender, race, ethnicity, years of education)</ul>
                <ul>- Medical history and records</ul>
                <ul>- Genetic information</ul>
                <ul>- Test results and diagnostic data</ul>
                <ul>- MRI images</ul>
            <h4>1.2 Usage Information</h4>
            <p>We may collect information about how the app is accessed and used, including:</p>
                <ul>- Device information (IP address, device type, operating system)</ul>
                <ul>- App usage patterns</ul>
                <ul>- Interactions with the app and its features</ul>
            <h3>2. How We Use Information</h3>
            <h4>2.1 Alzheimer's Prediction</h4>
            <p>The primary purpose of the app is to predict the likelihood of a patient developing Alzheimer's disease 
                in the next 5 years based on medical and genetic data. This information is intended for use by physicians 
                in diagnosing and treating patients. These predictions should not be used without physician review, and 
                users should use caution with the outputs due to the inherent error of a predictive model.</p>
            <h4>2.2 Service Improvement</h4>
            <p>Aggregated and anonymized data may be used to enhance the app's accuracy, effectiveness, and overall 
                performance through continuous research and development. This process ensures that our predictive 
                models evolve to incorporate the latest medical insights.</p>
            <h3>3. Information Sharing</h3>
            <h4>3.1 With Physicians</h4>
            <p>Authorized physicians will have access to patient data through a secure, HIPAA-compliant login. 
                This access is strictly for diagnostic and treatment purposes, enabling healthcare professionals to 
                make well-informed decisions for their patients.</p>
            <h4>3.2 Business Associate Agreement</h4>
            <p>Third-party businesses involved in handling patient data will be required to sign a Business Associate Agreement, 
                committing to HIPAA compliance and ensuring the utmost protection of patient information. This additional 
                layer of agreement is in place to reinforce our commitment to data security and privacy.</p>
            <h3>4. Data Security</h3>
            <h4>4.1 HIPAA Compliance</h4>
            <p>The app adheres strictly to HIPAA regulations to guarantee the confidentiality, integrity, and availability 
                of patient information. This compliance is continuously monitored and updated to align with the latest 
                industry standards.</p>
            <h4>4.2 Encryption</h4>
            <p>All data transmissions within the app and its connected database are encrypted to protect information from 
                unauthorized access.</p>
            <h3>5. Consent and Opt-Out</h3>
            <p>By utilizing the app, users implicitly consent to the collection and use of their information as outlined in 
                this Privacy Policy. Physicians and patients maintain the right to opt-out of data collection and request 
                the deletion of their information. We prioritize user agency and provide clear mechanisms for opting out.</p>
            <h3>6. Changes to Privacy Policy</h3>
            <p>We reserve the right to update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes in our practices. Users will be informed 
                of these changes through the app or website, and it is their responsibility to review the updated policy. 
                Any substantial changes will be communicated clearly, and user consent will be reaffirmed where necessary.</p>
